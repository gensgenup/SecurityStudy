# Contributing

## Branch Strategy

- Default branch is `main`.
- Do not push directly to `main`.
- Use branch prefixes: `feat/*`, `fix/*`, `chore/*`, `docs/*`.

## Commit Style

- Use Conventional Commits.
- Keep commit subject concise and imperative.

## Pull Requests

1. Sync with latest `main`.
2. Describe scope, assumptions, and risk.
3. Require at least one approval before merge.
4. Merge after required checks pass.

## Security

- Do not publish credentials, tokens, or private logs.
- Redact sensitive values in study notes and sample code.
